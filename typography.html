A <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Butterfly</font> once fell in love with a beautiful <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Rose</font>. And if the truth be told, the <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Rose</font> rather fancied the <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Butterfly</font>. He was very handsome indeed, with wings powdered in a charming pattern of gold and silver. And so, when he fluttered near and told the rose how he loved her, she blushed rosily and said she loved him back.
<br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="green"><u>For a while, they were happy spending all their free time together and never thought of anyone else. The <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Butterfly</font> would whisper sweet words of nothing in the roses’ petals. And the <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Rose</font> replied, “My my Mr <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Butterfly</font>, I do declare, your sweet words could charm the morning dew right off the honeysuckle.” They exchanged solemn vows to love no one else but each other.</u></font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="blood red"><sup>Then one day, the <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Butterfly</font> announced that he had to fly away on business.
<br>
<br>
"No need for tears. I will soon return. Never doubt that you are my One True Love," he said as he left.
<br>
<br>
But alas! It was a long time before he came back.</sup></font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="Royal blue"><sub>"Is this what you mean by one true love?" she exclaimed tearfully. "It has been ages since you went away, and all that time, you have been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Miss Orchid</font>, and you were fluttering hopelessly around <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Miss Mignonette</font> until <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Bumble bee</font> chased you away. I wish he had stung you!"
<br>
<br>
"One True Love,” laughed the <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Butterfly</font>. "I had no sooner left you than I saw the <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Westerly breeze</font>, <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Mr Zephyr</font>, blowing you hot kisses. You were giggling coyly with <font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="violet">Mr. Bumble bee</font> , and you made eyes at every single Bug you could see. You can't expect any One True Love from me!"</sub></font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica" size="14" color="Yellow"><i>And the moral is,
Do not expect to be loved with all of someone’s heart … unless you love them with all of yours.</i></font>
