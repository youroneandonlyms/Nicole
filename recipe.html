<h1>Filipino Pork Adobo</h1>
<br>
<i>
<h2>This is a recipe post for Filipino Pork Adobo. It is a dish composed of pork slices cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. There are version wherein onions are also added. Adobo is a popular dish in the Philippines, along with Sinigang.<br><br>Adobo, in general, can be cooked using different kinds of protein. Chicken is the commonly used ingredient.</h2>

<h3>Filipino Pork Adobo v.s Mexican Adobo</h3>
<p>The word Adobo was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. It means to marinate. This can be in the form of a liquid marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.<br><br>This version of Filipino Adobo suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. By preference, vinegar can also be added as a marinade ingredient.<br><br>Mexican adobo, on the other hand, makes use of chillies, garlic, cinnamon, and oregano as marinade.<br><br>Both dishes look and taste different. It will be unfair to compare which among the two dishes are best because each of us has our own preference when it comes to flavor.</p>
<br>
<h3>Filipino Pork Adobo Versions</h3>
<h3 style="color:red;">Pork and Chicken Adobo</h3>
<p>Almost every region in the Philippines have their own pork adobo version. Sometimes, there can be more than one version in a location.<br><br>This is one of the favorite when it comes to family picnics. This is a dish wherein pork and chicken slices are combined and cooked inadobo style. It can be done the same way as this recipe, with or without onions. This is our clans signature summer dish in the Philippines.</p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Pork Adobo with Potato</h3>
<p>This is a saucier pork adobo version with cubes of potatoes in it. I’m not sure where this dish originated. It might have been initially created as a filler to feed more people. Nevertheless, I liked the taste. I think that it can be improved by pan-frying the potato first. Most of the flavors gets absorbed by the potato. It can be a carbohydrate overload when you eat the potato with rice. This is a good dish to have when before going to the gym or before starting a marathon.</p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Pork Adobo with Eggs</h3>
<p>There are two ways to make it. Both ways require boiling the eggs beforehand. The first version is cooked by adding boiled eggs once the pork gets tender. The eggs absorb the soy sauce, thus becomes darker in color. Be cautious about the time when cooking this way. We don’t want to overcook the eggs.<br><br>The other version of the adobo with egg is easier and does not put the eggs at risk of overcooking (unless it was overcooked during the boiling process). Simply add boiled eggs on the serving plate before serving. The eggs also retains its white color.</p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Pork Adobo with Tofu</h3>
<p>This is a protein-rich adobo version. It is perfect for people who like their adobo mild in flavor. This version requires fried tofu. Always use extra firm tofu when making this. You can purchase raw tofu and fry it, or you can get packaged fried tofu from the supermarket.The tofu absorbs most of the sauce in the process which tones down the flavor a bit. This is a good dish to prepare when you are into body building or into a protein-rich diet. Make sure to use lean cuts of pork though.</p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Spicy Pork Adobo</h3>
<p>This is the perfect pulutan as far as I am concerned. The spicier it gets, the better it becomes. Making this dish using the former spiciest chili pepper in the world, Bhut Jolokia (It lost its crown to the Carolina Reaper, which is way spicier). The result was a very delicious and extremely spicy adobo. The spice lingers in the mouth for a while. Be forewarned.</p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Adobong Baboy sa Gata</h3>
<p>Classic! This is notorious for making people on limited-rice-diet crave for more rice. It is very rich, tasty, and delicious. Add a few pieces of Thai chili pepper, and you will not get enough of it.</p>
